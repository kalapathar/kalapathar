### Hi Github Community! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ **2020 Goal**<br>
    - I want to contribute to non-profits. <br>
        - I recently started working on a platform to [connect donors with charities](https://devpost.com/software/craigs-help). I am learning React, Amplify and many new things. <br>
        - I am also one of the listener at 7Cups. What that means is that I am there to listen and chat with people who might be struggling emotionally and mentally. I would like to become more compassionate.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes. I work for Sports Engine in Minneapolis.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Nepal, Minneapolis or SHA256!!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can speak a bit of Hungarian! I learnt that to communicate with locals as I studied abroad for a semester in Budapest.
- â˜• Wanna chat? ðŸ‘‰ @ me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kalopatthar)
